# graphQLStudy

1. GraphQL is a data query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
2. GraphQL is strongly typed, meaning that every field and every type in a GraphQL schema has a specific purpose and meaning.
3. GraphQL is introspective, meaning that a GraphQL server can tell you what types and fields it has available.
4. GraphQL is compositional, meaning that you can build larger and more complex types by combining smaller, simpler types.
5. GraphQL is layered, meaning that you can use it to build new data on top of existing data, without changing the underlying data.
6.  GraphQL is flexible, meaning that you can use it to query data from multiple sources, and you can extend it to add new functionality.
